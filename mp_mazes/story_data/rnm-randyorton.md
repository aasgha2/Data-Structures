You, the champ, walk out with your music. Your fans cheer you expeditiously. The Viper Randy Orton sneaks into the ring from behind you and hits you with a DDT
right from the start. You're dazed, confused, but you pull uourself together to deliver a series of punches. Jab. Cross. Jab. Cross. Finally, you're left with two choices: 
End the match with your finisher, or beat down your opponent some more with your signature "You Can't See Me"

# rnm-signature
You work the Viper into a "You Can't See Me"

# rnm-finisher
You atempt to deliver an "Attitude Adjustment"
